<h1>Best Movies According To Me</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>This was the first horror movie that really scared me. Plus I love a good demoic posession and exorcism.</p>

<h3>Eastern Promise</h3>
<p>I watched this during my final year of university living in London, and the mafia setting and storyline seemed so real.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This movie made me cry! The relationships were perfectly crafted and real, and the science made sense even when it was too technical for me to even comprehend.</p>
